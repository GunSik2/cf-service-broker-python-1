CloudFoundry (and Stackato and HP Helion Development Platform) provide a Service Broker API (http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html), currently in version 2.3, that accommodates managed services, such as databases. This repository contains an implementaiton of a service broker for a [simplified echo service](https://github.com/dwatrous/cf-echo-service).

#### Dependencies
 * Python 3.x
 * bottle (http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html)
 * requests

# Usage

The service broker can be run easily on any system that satisfies the dependiencies above. This repository also contains artifacts that make it easy to deploy to Stackato or HP Helion Development Platform.
